# Person re-identification with pose and camera invariance Adversarial Neural Network

## Setup environment
Python version : 3.10.6
Ptorch version : 1.13.0
Torchvision version : 0.14.0 
CUDA : 11.7

Install code requirement
```
conda create -n pat python==3.10.6 -y
conda activate pat
pip --default-timeout=1000 install -r freeze_env/requirements.txt
```

## Generate pose labels
First, please follow the tutorial from OpenPose repository [[link](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/master/doc/installation/0_index.md#windows-portable-demo)] to setup the OpenPose.
Run the following code to generate pose keypoint of our datasets
```
./build/x64/Release/OpenPoseDemo.exe --image_dir $PATH --write_json ${Dataset}_jsons/ --write_images ${Dataset}_images/ --display 0 --disable_blending
```
, and save the keypoints to `PAT_REID/pose_label_generation/pose_result`.

After that, the pose labels can be generated by run the following command
```
cd pose_label_generation
python clustering.py --dataset ${DATASET} --n_cluster ${NUM_CLUSTER} --mode ${MODE} --none_mode ${NONE_MODE} --save_json
```
-> The possible option:
```
MODE="each_cam", "overall"
NONE_MODE="ignore", "cam_labels", "new_label"
DATASET="market", "duke", "msmt17", "lab_combine"
```


## Start the model training
Option
Dataset : "market1501", "dukemtmc-reid", "lab_data", "msmt17", "cuhk03"  
Arch : "resnet50", "resnet_ibn50a", "osnet_ain_x0_5"

```bash
cd SSKD
bash scripts/pose_cam_at_mmt.sh ${SOURCE} ${TARGET} ${ARCH}
```
